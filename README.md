# Hi grading team and Krystina! I really gave it a try, but had to run to catch a flight out of town. I couldnt quite figure out the CSS and the deployment to Heroku. If I had more time I would have! I have deployed to Heroku for another class but couldnt brush off the cobwebs to do it within the short time I had this morning.  
# I appreciate the help over the quarter and wish you all the best. 
# Thanks!
